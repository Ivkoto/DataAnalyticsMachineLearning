- explain in each graph - why you chose this exact graph, this colors, etc. - for David
I am using the color blue becasue according to .... this is an appropriate color and here it can be seen. 
If we have a dwo dimensional data (two clomuns), we should make sure we visualize in 2d(two-dimensional) graph. Won't be appropriate to use a 3d (cube for example)
